<h1>Cover Letter</h1>
<p>I heard about the position of App/Web Developer from Erin Straza in a forum of which we are both members. I was immediately intrigued about the SpreadTruth organization and the position.</p>

<p>Having worked for about 15 years in web development, I have gained quite a lot of experience with many web technologies and techniques. In recent years, as mobile usage has exploded, I have expanded to using responsive web design techniques and begun working in mobile app development.</p>

<p>What really excites me about the position, though, is the chance to be part of something bigger. That was what prompted my move from the insurance world to education nine years ago, and having the opportunity to be part of spreading the gospel as my main occupation would be tremendously exciting.</p>

<p>I can be contacted by email or telephone to arrange an interview. I look forward to the opportunity to interview and to work with you as your App/Web Developer.</p>
